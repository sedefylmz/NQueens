Project Title:  Solving the N-Queens Problem with Exhaustive Search and Genetic Algorithms

NOTE: COMPULSORY ASSIGNMENT WORTH 40 POINTS

Objective: Design and implement all four approaches to solving the N-Queens problem: 

An exhaustive depth-first search solution.
A Greedy search based solution.
A Simulated Annelaing based solution. 
A genetic algorithm-based solution. 
Compare the four approaches for solving the N-Queens problem with N = 10, N = 30,  N = 50, N = 100, and N = 200 in terms of computational time and efficiency. 

Instructions: 

Design Phase: 
Choose a programming language of your preference. 
Develop algorithms to solve the N-Queens problem using: 
Exhaustive search (depth-first).
Local Greedy search (Hill Climbing).
Local Simulated Annealing. 
Optimization Algorithm (Genetic algorithms (discussed in class)). 
Document the design considerations, including algorithm selection and optimization techniques (if any) for each approach. 
Implementation Phase: 
Implement all solutions based on the designs discussed in the class. 
Test your implementations with N = 10, N = 30,  N = 50, N = 100, and N = 200. 
Record the execution time and memory consumed for each case. 
Analysis and Comparison: 
Analyze the performance of both approaches, particularly focusing on the time taken and max memory utilized for each problem size. 
Compare the effectiveness of the each approach, commenting on any significant differences in performance in terms of accuracy, and time and memory taken. 
Report: 
Document the details of your design, implementation, and results.
